	abstract = {Developing new imputation methodology has become a very active ﬁeld. Unfortunately, there is no consensus on how to perform simulation studies to evaluate the properties of imputation methods. In this paper I propose a move towards a standardized evaluation of imputation methods. To demonstrate the need for standardization, I highlight a set of potential pitfalls that bring forth a chain of potential problems in the objective assessment of the performance of imputation routines. This may lead to suboptimal use of multiple imputation in practice. Additionally, I suggest a course of action for simulating and evaluating missing data problems.},

The objective is valid frequency inference for ultimate users who in general have access only to complete-data software and possess limited knowledge of specific reasons and models for nonresponse. For this situation and objective, I believe that multiple imputation by the data-base constructor is the method of choice. This article first provides a description of the assumed context and objectives, and second, reviews the multiple imputation framework and its standard results. These preliminary discussions are especially important because some recent commentaries on multiple imputation have reflected either misunderstandings of the practical objectives of multiple imputation or misunderstandings of fundamental theoretical results. Then, criticisms of multiple imputation are considered, and, finally, comparisons are made to alternative strategies.]},

Imputation of partially observed covariates is complicated if the substantive model is non-linear (e.g. Cox proportional hazards model), or contains non-linear (e.g. squared) or interaction terms, and standard software implementations of multiple imputation may impute covariates from models that are incompatible with such substantive models. We show how imputation by fully conditional specification, a popular approach for performing multiple imputation, can be modified so that covariates are imputed from models which are compatible with the substantive model. We investigate through simulation the performance of this proposal, and compare it with existing approaches. Simulation results suggest our proposal gives consistent estimates for a range of common substantive models, including models which contain non-linear covariate effects or interactions, provided data are missing at random and the assumed imputation models are correctly specified and mutually compatible.

	abstract = {Multiple imputation (MI) has become a standard statistical technique for dealing with missing values. The CDC Anthrax Vaccine Research Program (AVRP) dataset created new challenges for MI due to the large number of variables of different types and the limited sample size. A common method for imputing missing data in such complex studies is to specify, for each of J variables with missing values, a univariate conditional distribution given all other variables, and then to draw imputations by iterating over the J conditional distributions. Such fully conditional imputation strategies have the theoretical drawback that the conditional distributions may be incompatible. When the missingness pattern is monotone, a theoretically valid approach is to specify, for each variable with missing values, a conditional distribution given the variables with fewer or the same number of missing values and sequentially draw from these distributions. In this article, we propose the “multiple imputation by ordered monotone blocks” approach, which combines these two basic approaches by decomposing any missingness pattern into a collection of smaller “constructed” monotone missingness patterns, and iterating. We apply this strategy to impute the missing data in the AVRP interim data. Supplemental materials, including all source code and a synthetic example dataset, are available online.},

	abstract = {The Gibbs sampler, the algorithm of Metropolis and similar iterative simulation methods are potentially very helpful for summarizing multivariate distributions. Used naively, however, iterative simulation can give misleading answers. Our methods are simple and generally applicable to the output of any iterative simulation; they are designed for researchers primarily interested in the science underlying the data and models they are analyzing, rather than for researchers interested in the probability theory underlying the iterative simulations themselves. Our recommended strategy is to use several independent sequences, with starting points sampled from an overdispersed distribution. At each step of the iterative simulation, we obtain, for each univariate estimand of interest, a distributional estimate and an estimate of how much sharper the distributional estimate might become if the simulations were continued indefinitely. Because our focus is on applied inference for Bayesian posterior distributions in real problems, which often tend toward normality after transformations and marginalization, we derive our results as normal-theory approximations to exact Bayesian inference, conditional on the observed simulations. The methods are illustrated on a random-effects mixture model applied to experimental measurements of reaction times of normal and schizophrenic patients.},

In the literature, multiple imputation is known to be the standard method to handle missing data. While the theory of multiple imputation has been known for decades, the implementation is difficult due to the complicated nature of random draws from the posterior distribution. Thus, there are several computational algorithms in software: Data Augmentation (DA), Fully Conditional Specification (FCS), and Expectation-Maximization with Bootstrapping (EMB). Although the literature is full of comparisons between joint modeling (DA, EMB) and conditional modeling (FCS), little is known about the relative superiority between the MCMC algorithms (DA, FCS) and the non-MCMC algorithm (EMB), where MCMC stands for Markov chain Monte Carlo. Based on simulation experiments, the current study contends that EMB is a confidence proper (confidence-supporting) multiple imputation algorithm without between-imputation iterations; thus, EMB is more user-friendly than DA and FCS.},

It is a flexible approach for handling different types of variables and complex data structures. Many simulation studies have shown that the multiple imputation inferences based on this procedure have desirable repeated sampling properties. However, a theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specification of a set of conditional regression models may not be compatible with a joint distribution of the variables being imputed. Hence, the convergence properties of the iterative algorithm are not well understood. This article develops conditions for convergence and assesses the properties of inferences from both compatible and incompatible sequence of regression models. The results are established for the missing data pattern where each subject may be missing a value on at most one variable. The sequence of regression models are assumed to be empirically good fit for the data chosen by the imputer based on appropriate model diagnostics. The results are used to develop criteria for the choice of regression models. Supplementary materials for this article are available online.},

In Gambia, a study helps a vaccination program reduce the incidence of Hepatitis B carriage. Archaeologists in Austria place a Bronze Age site in its true temporal location on the calendar scale. And in France, researchers map a rare disease with relatively little variation.Each of these studies applied Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to produce more accurate and inclusive results. General state-space Markov chain theory has seen several developments that have made it both more accessible and more powerful to the general statistician. Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice introduces MCMC methods and their applications, providing some theoretical background as well. The authors are researchers who have made key contributions in the recent development of MCMC methodology and its application. Considering the broad audience, the editors emphasize practice rather than theory, keeping the technical content to a minimum. The examples range from the simplest application, Gibbs sampling, to more complex applications. The first chapter contains enough information to allow the reader to start applying MCMC in a basic way. The following chapters cover main issues, important concepts and results, techniques for implementing MCMC, improving its performance, assessing model adequacy, choosing between models, and applications and their domains.Markov Chain Monte Carlo in Practice is a thorough, clear introduction to the methodology and applications of this simple idea with enormous potential.

	abstract = {Specialized imputation routines for multilevel data are widely available in software packages, but these methods are generally not equipped to handle a wide range of complexities that are typical of behavioral science data. In particular, existing imputation schemes differ in their ability to handle random slopes, categorical variables, differential relations at level-1 and level-2, and incomplete level-2 variables. Given the limitations of existing imputation tools, the purpose of this manuscript is to describe a flexible imputation approach that can accommodate a diverse set of two-level analysis problems that includes any of the aforementioned features. The procedure employs a fully conditional specification (also known as chained equations) approach with a latent variable formulation for handling incomplete categorical variables. Computer simulations suggest that the proposed procedure works quite well, with trivial biases in most cases. We provide a software program that implements the imputation strategy, and we use an artificial data set to illustrate its use.},

Many software packages are available to multiply impute the missing values and to analyze the resulting completed data sets. However, diagnostic tools to check the validity of the imputations are limited, and the majority of the currently available methods need considerable knowledge of the imputation model. In many practical settings, however, the imputer and the analyst may be different individuals or from different organizations, and the analyst model may or may not be congenial to the model used by the imputer. This article develops and evaluates a set of graphical and numerical diagnostic tools for two practical purposes: (i) for an analyst to determine whether the imputations are reasonable under his/her model assumptions without actually knowing the imputation model assumptions; and (ii) for an imputer to fine tune the imputation model by checking the key characteristics of the observed and imputed values. The tools are based on the numerical and graphical comparisons of the distributions of the observed and imputed values conditional on the propensity of response. The methodology is illustrated using simulated data sets created under a variety of scenarios. The examples focus on continuous and binary variables, but the principles can be used to extend methods for other types of variables. Copyright © 2016 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

In a missing data model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either (but not necessarily both) a model for the missingness mechanism or a model for the distribution of the complete data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that either a missingness model or a complete data model is correct, perhaps the best that can be hoped for is to find a DR estimator. DR estimators, in contrast to standard likelihood-based or (nonaugmented) inverse probability-weighted estimators, give the analyst two chances, instead of only one, to make a valid inference. In a causal inference model, an estimator is DR if it remains consistent when either a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the distribution of the counterfactual data is correctly specified. Because with observational data one can never be sure that a model for the treatment assignment mechanism or a model for the counterfactual data is correct, inference based on DR estimators should improve upon previous approaches. Indeed, we present the results of simulation studies which demonstrate that the finite sample performance of DR estimators is as impressive as theory would predict. The proposed method is applied to a cardiovascular clinical trial.},

	abstract = {Conducting sample surveys, imputing incomplete observations, and analyzing the resulting data are three indispensable phases of modern practice with public-use data files and with many other statistical applications. Each phase inherits different input, including the information preceding it and the intellectual assessments available, and aims to provide output that is one step closer to arriving at statistical inferences with scientific relevance. However, the role of the imputation phase has often been viewed as merely providing computational convenience for users of data. Although facilitating computation is very important, such a viewpoint ignores the imputer's assessments and information inaccessible to the users. This view underlies the recent controversy over the validity of multiple-imputation inference when a procedure for analyzing multiply imputed data sets cannot be derived from (is "uncongenial" to) the model adopted for multiple imputation. Given sensible imputations and complete-data analysis procedures, inferences from standard multiple-imputation combining rules are typically superior to, and thus different from, users' incomplete-data analyses. The latter may suffer from serious nonresponse biases because such analyses often must rely on convenient but unrealistic assumptions about the nonresponse mechanism. When it is desirable to conduct inferences under models for nonresponse other than the original imputation model, a possible alternative to recreating imputations is to incorporate appropriate importance weights into the standard combining rules. These points are reviewed and explored by simple examples and general theory, from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, particularly from the randomization perspective. Some convenient terms are suggested for facilitating communication among researchers from different perspectives when evaluating multiple-imputation inferences with uncongenial sources of input.},

Although this problem must arise in most reported economic evaluations containing patient-level data, it is rare for authors to detail how the problem was overcome. Statistical packages may default to handling missing data through a so-called ‘complete case analysis’, while some recent cost-analyses have appeared to favour an ‘available case’ approach. Both of these methods are problematic: complete case analysis is inefficient and is likely to be biased; available case analysis, by employing different numbers of observations for each resource use item, generates severe problems for standard statistical inference. Instead we explore imputation methods for generating ‘replacement’ values for missing data that will permit complete case analysis using the whole data set and we illustrate these methods using two data sets that had incomplete resource use information.

We show that this class of estimators find immediate use in the Gelman-Rubin statistic, a connection not established in the literature before. We incorporate these estimators to upgrade both the univariate and multivariate Gelman-Rubin statistics, leading to increased stability in MCMC termination time. An immediate advantage is that our new Gelman-Rubin statistic can be calculated for a single chain. In addition, we establish a relationship between the Gelman-Rubin statistic and effective sample size. Leveraging this relationship, we develop a principled cutoff criterion for the Gelman-Rubin statistic. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of our improved diagnostic via examples.},

We show how such a diagnostic may be useful in assessing the performance of MCMC samplers addressing model choice problems, such as the reversible jump MCMC algorithm. In the model choice context, we show how the reversible jump MCMC simulation output for parameters that retain a coherent interpretation throughout the simulation, can be used to assess convergence. By considering various decompositions of the sampling variance of this parameter, we can assess the performance of our MCMC sampler in terms of its mixing properties both within and between models and we illustrate our approach in both the graphical Gaussian models and normal mixtures context. Finally, we provide an example of the application of our diagnostic to the assessment of the influence of different starting values on MCMC simulation output, thereby illustrating the wider utility of our method beyond the Bayesian model choice and reversible jump MCMC context.},

	abstract = {Current pooling rules for multiply imputed data assume infinite populations. In some situations this assumption is not feasible as every unit in the population has been observed, potentially leading to over-covered population estimates. We simplify the existing pooling rules for situations where the sampling variance is not of interest. We compare these rules to the conventional pooling rules and demonstrate their use in a situation where there is no sampling variance. Using the standard pooling rules in situations where sampling variance should not be considered, leads to overestimation of the variance of the estimates of interest, especially when the amount of missingness is not very large. As a result, populations estimates are over-covered, which may lead to a loss of statistical power. We conclude that the theory of multiple imputation can be extended to the situation where the sample happens to be the population. The simplified pooling rules can be easily implemented to obtain valid inference in cases where we have observed essentially all units and in simulation studies addressing the missingness mechanism only.},

This article presents a simulation and data analysis case study using a method for dealing with missing data, multiple imputation, that allows for valid statistical inference with complete case statistical analysis. Software for implementing multiple imputation under a multivariate normal model is freely and widely available (e.g., NORM, SAS, SOLAS). It should be routinely considered for imputing missing data.

The theoretical weakness of this approach is that the specified conditional densities can be incompatible, and therefore the stationary distribution to which the Gibbs sampler attempts to converge may not exist. This study investigates practical consequences of this problem by means of simulation. Missing data are created under four different missing data mechanisms. Attention is given to the statistical behavior under compatible and incompatible models. The results indicate that multiple imputation produces essentially unbiased estimates with appropriate coverage in the simple cases investigated, even for the incompatible models. Of particular interest is that these results were produced using only five Gibbs iterations starting from a simple draw from observed marginal distributions. It thus appears that, despite the theoretical weaknesses, the actual performance of conditional model specification for multivariate imputation can be quite good, and therefore deserves further study.},

In the context of regression analysis, combination rules for the unstandardized regression coefficients, the t-tests of the regression coefficients, and the F-tests for testing \$\$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$\$R2 for significance have long been established. However, there is still no general agreement on how to combine the point estimators of \$\$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$\$R2 in multiple regression applied to multiply imputed datasets. Additionally, no combination rules for standardized regression coefficients and their confidence intervals seem to have been developed at all. In the current article, two sets of combination rules for the standardized regression coefficients and their confidence intervals are proposed, and their statistical properties are discussed. Additionally, two improved point estimators of \$\$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$\$R2 in multiply imputed data are proposed, which in their computation use the pooled standardized regression coefficients. Simulations show that the proposed pooled standardized coefficients produce only small bias and that their 95\% confidence intervals produce coverage close to the theoretical 95\%. Furthermore, the simulations show that the newly proposed pooled estimates for \$\$R{\textasciicircum}\{2\}\$\$R2 are less biased than two earlier proposed pooled estimates.},

Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition provides a clearly written exploration of the key methods for building, classifying, testing, and analyzing stochastic models for time series and describes their use in five important areas of application: forecasting; determining the transfer function of a system; modeling the effects of intervention events; developing multivariate dynamic models; and designing simple control schemes. Along with these classical uses, the new edition covers modern topics with new features that include:  A redesigned chapter on multivariate time series analysis with an expanded treatment of Vector Autoregressive, or VAR models, along with a discussion of the analytical tools needed for modeling vector time series An expanded chapter on special topics covering unit root testing, time-varying volatility models such as ARCH and GARCH, nonlinear time series models, and long memory models Numerous examples drawn from finance, economics, engineering, and other related fields The use of the publicly available R software for graphical illustrations and numerical calculations along with scripts that demonstrate the use of R for model building and forecasting Updates to literature references throughout and new end-of-chapter exercises Streamlined chapter introductions and revisions that update and enhance the exposition  Time Series Analysis: Forecasting and Control, Fifth Edition is a valuable real-world reference for researchers and practitioners in time series analysis, econometrics, finance, and related fields. The book is also an excellent textbook for beginning graduate-level courses in advanced statistics, mathematics, economics, finance, engineering, and physics.},
