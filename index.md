The app is part of the `amices` universe ('a home for the growing MICE family'). Amices is a place for people interested in solving missing data problems. Find us online on GitHub or our [website](amices.org). For an introduction to missing data and imputation methods, see the open access book 'Flexible Imputation of Missing Data' (van Buuren, 2018).

For a demo version of the app, see [hanneoberman.shinyapps.io/shinymice-demo](https://hanneoberman.shinyapps.io/shinymice-demo/).
